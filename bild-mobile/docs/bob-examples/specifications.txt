SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS — PROJECT REFERENCE

This document summarizes materials, codes, tolerances, and inspection requirements. Full specification sections take precedence.

CODES AND STANDARDS
- Local building code (jurisdiction as per permit).
- National building and fire codes as adopted.
- All work to comply with applicable codes and approved drawings.

MATERIALS (EXAMPLES — CONFIRM IN CONTRACT SPECS)
- Structural: As per structural drawings and engineer’s specs (e.g. specified steel, concrete grade, reinforcement).
- Envelope: Roofing, cladding, and flashing per approved submittals and manufacturer instructions.
- MEP: Equipment and materials per mechanical, electrical, and plumbing spec sections and approved submittals.
- Finishes: Paint, flooring, and trim per finish schedule and spec sections.

TOLERANCES
- Vertical and horizontal alignment per ACI and structural notes (e.g. ±1/4" in 10' for framing where noted).
- Floor flatness and levelness per specified F-number or equivalent.
- All tolerances as stated in the contract specifications; tighter tolerances only if explicitly required.

INSPECTION AND TESTING
- Hold points: Foundations (before pour), structural steel (connections), MEP rough-in (before concealment), and final commissioning as per spec.
- Third-party inspections where required by code or contract (e.g. soils, structural, fire alarm).
- All inspections must be passed and documented before proceeding to the next phase.

SUBMITTALS
- Submittals approved in writing before ordering or installing. No substitutions without written approval.
- O&M manuals and as-builts required prior to substantial completion.

For full requirements, always refer to the contract specification book and latest revision of the drawings.
